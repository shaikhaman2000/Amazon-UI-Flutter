# amzon_clone_app

Amazon Clone Flutter Application UI.

## Getting Started

Clone this Repo and Connect with your own Firebase Firestore DB to get started with this.
I have used Firebase Firestore as Database and Firebase Storage to store App Images.
I will be continuously updating App & it's functions.
